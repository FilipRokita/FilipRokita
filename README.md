# About me
Hi there! My name is Filip and I am a passionate software developer with years of experience in the field.

I have always been fascinated by technology and its ability to make a difference in people's lives. That's what led me to pursue a career in software development. Throughout my career, I have worked on a variety of projects, from small-scale web applications to large enterprise systems.

On my GitHub profile, you'll mainly find smaller hobby projects and useful applications that I have developed in my spare time. I enjoy exploring new technologies and experimenting with different programming languages.

If you're interested in collaborating on a larger project or have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me through my website at www.filiprokita.com. I am always open to new opportunities and love working with other developers to create innovative solutions.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me!
